# My app for danish and some european charging stations
## Eveidently more EV's are on the road

From selling very few apps for this niche area, I am now up and selling almost 1 every day. For that is a proof that many more EV's are hitting the road, a very good sign indeed.
You can get the app [ladeapp.dk](http://ladeapp.dk) here or directly on the app store [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ladeapp-dk/id1436754873?ls=1&mt=8) )
This app has all Clever, Eon and Ionity chargers on it.
