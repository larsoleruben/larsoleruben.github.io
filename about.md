Hi.
I am working as a data engineer at [Ørsted](https://orsted.com). I have been at Ørsted since 2008 and it has been quite a journey. The company went from being a state owned public company to a listed comnpany on the Danish Stock Exchange and from relying almost only on fossil fuels to a company making only renewable energy. All this while being profitable and since our IPO the value of the company has tripled.
At Ørsted I am currentely working on a project involving REGOS and GOO's which are cerftificates proving the energy is really comming from renewable sources.
To do my job I use a mix of very common tools. Of course we use a lot of SQL on good old RDBMS systems, be it from Oracle, Microsoft and even Postgresql. But not any MySql unfortunately!
