## A word of warning
It is very comme to see installation scripts for various programs usign a curl reference to get the script from a remote computer's website. Never just do that, follow the url and have a look at what the script is doing. Just remember, you give the script somebody else wrote, elevated rights on your box! 

## All the curl commands I can't remember

### Download a file from a website
```bash
curl http://some.url --output some.file
```
