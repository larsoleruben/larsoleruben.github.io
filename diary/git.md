# Git

### Reset your local repo to the remote and overwrite changes

```Git
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/master
```

### The command to list all branches in local and remote repositories is:
```git
it branch -a
```
### If you require only listing the remote branches from Git Bash then use this command:
```git
git branch -r
```

### You may also use the show-branch command for seeing the branches and their commits as follows:
```git
git show-branch
```
### Se changes at last commit
```git
git whatchanged <option>…​
```
